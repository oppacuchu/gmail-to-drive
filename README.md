# gmail-to-drive
Archive Gmail emails directly into a Google Drive folder. This add-on works only on a Google Workspace account.

Go to script.google.com and create a new project, then copy recreate the structure of the Project folder. The files should be in the following order (otherwise the files won't be loaded in the correct order):
1) appsscript.json
2) GDrive
3) Misc
4) Settings
5) Cards
6) Code

Then you should enable the project on your profile in order to use it (google it until I update this readme with more info).
